# Setup:
To run this mini project on your device, you need the `opencv` package.

## Linux:
You can use `pip` tool to get the necessary packages:

  `$ sudo apt install python3-pip`
  
  `$ pip install opencv-python`

## Windows:
`<pip>` should work on Windows as well. But personally, I would recommend PyCharm or any other IDE to manage your Python packages in Windows, so the configuration is varied from your IDE. Search it online.

# Oversized file:
The model for pose detection is oversized in GitHub, please [download](http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/OpenPose/models/pose/mpi/pose_iter_160000.caffemodel
) it manually and add it into `Resources/` folder.
