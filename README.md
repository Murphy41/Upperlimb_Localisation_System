# Setup:
To run this mini project on your device, you need the `opencv` package.

## Linux:
You can use `<pip>` tool to get the necessary packages:

  `$ sudo apt install python3-pip`
  
  `$ pip install opencv-python`

## Windows:
`<pip>` should work on Windows as well. But personally, I would recommend PyCharm or any other IDE to manage your Python packages in Windows, so the configuration is varied from your IDE. Search it online.
